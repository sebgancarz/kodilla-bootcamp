      <p>I am the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. According to
        radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, I was formed over 4.5 billion years ago. My gravity interacts
        with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, my only natural satellite. I revolve around the
        Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, I am rotating about my own axis about
        366.26 times.</p>
      <p>My axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational
        interaction between me and the Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes my orientation on its axis, and gradually
        slows its rotation. I am the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial
        planets.</p>

            <h3 class="skill-title">Erthquakes</h3>
            <p>An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth, resulting from the sudden release of energy in
              the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are so
              weak that they cannot be felt to those violent enough to toss people around and destroy whole cities. The
              seismicity, or seismic activity, of an area is the frequency, type and size of earthquakes experienced
              over a period of time. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by shaking and displacing
              or disrupting the ground. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be
              displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can also trigger landslides, and occasionally
              volcanic activity. <a class="skill-source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake" target="_blank">More...</a></p>

            <h3 class="skill-title">Cyclones</h3>
            <p>In meteorology, a cyclone is a large scale air mass that rotates around a strong center of low
              atmospheric pressure. Cyclones are characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate about a zone of
              low pressure. The largest low-pressure systems are polar vortices and extratropical cyclones of the
              largest scale (the synoptic scale). Warm-core cyclones such as tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones
              also lie within the synoptic scale. Mesocyclones, tornadoes and dust devils lie within smaller mesoscale.
              Upper level cyclones can exist without the presence of a surface low, and can pinch off from the base of
              the tropical upper tropospheric trough during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. <a class="skill-source"

            <h3 class="skill-title">Tsunamis</h3>
            <p>A tsunami, sometimes incorrectly referred to as a tidal wave, also known as a seismic sea wave, is a
              series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an
              ocean or a large lake. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other underwater explosions (including
              detonations of underwater nuclear devices), landslides, glacier calvings, meteorite impacts and other
              disturbances above or below water all have the potential to generate a tsunami. Unlike normal ocean
              waves, which are generated by wind, or tides, which are generated by the gravitational pull of the Moon
              and the Sun, a tsunami is generated by the displacement of water. <a class="skill-source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunami"

            <h3 class="skill-title">Volcanos</h3>
            <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava,
              volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.
              Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic plates that float on a
              hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic
              plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, such
              as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of
              Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is
              stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift and the Wells
              Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America. <a class="skill-source" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"
